### What's up! 🍪

I started my coding adventure back in '17. My first experiences were with Python and computer vision projects. Later I moved on to JavaScript and focused on building my front-end skills. 

Currently focused on developing skills in:
- ⚛️ React
- 📝 Typescript
- 🔺 Next.js
- 🎨 UI design
- 🧪 Testing
- 🤖 APIs

Also passionate about:
- 🇨🇳 Chinese language & tech in China (你会说中文吗？)
- 🎧 Podcasts
- 🚲 Cycling

Thanks for making it this far! 🙌
